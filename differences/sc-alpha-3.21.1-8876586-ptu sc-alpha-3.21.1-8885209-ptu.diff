+ TarPits_ShipStrip_desc_001=Got a particular salvage job that we could use some extra hands on. \n\nWe need you to find a ~mission(ship) that got punched out around ~mission(location). Security’s already searching for it and if they find it, they’ll ID it for sure and we’ll be in loads of trouble.\n\nSo, we want you to make sure that can’t happen. Either tow the ship out of the search area or rip the entire hull off so nobody can tell who it belonged to. Whatever you decide, keep your mouth shut about this. \n\nWe’ll cred you up and anything you scrap is yours to keep. But if security finds the ship before you’re done, we’ll all be screwed and you won’t get paid so don’t disappoint.
+ TarPits_TimedSalvage_Desc_01=We’ve got our eye on a ~mission(ship) near ~mission(location) that’s ripe for salvaging. We’re too busy to snag it ourselves, so why not spread the wealth, right?\n\nIf you send us some credits, we’ll send you the ship’s exact coordinates. Don’t take too long to think it over, though. You’ve probably got about ~mission(timer) minutes until security gets there to check out the wreck. Could be more, could be less.\n\nYou could either tow it somewhere else first, or you could try to scrap what you can onsite before security shows. Don’t care which as long as you get it taken care of. And once you've salvaged everything you want, just go ahead and abandon this contract to clear your map. Helps keep everything nice and tidy.
