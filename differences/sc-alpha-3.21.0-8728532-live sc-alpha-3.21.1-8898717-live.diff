+ BrightSky_Desc=The CDF has partnered with Anvil Aerospace to find the most capable operatives in the system. \n\nIf you find one of these Platinum certifications, you can redeem the ticket at a ship kiosk at New Deal, Astro Armada or Crusader Showroom for a free F8C. \n\nThe catch is that your identity and location has been shared with participants throughout the system. For everyone else, if you can stop the ticketholder before they get to the kiosk, you can claim the ticket for your own.\n\nWhoever makes it will not only receive this next generation superiority fighter, but also prove that they have what it takes for the toughest CDF assignments.\n\nGood luck.
+ BrightSky_From=Civilian Defense Force
+ BrightSky_Hunter_Desc=In an effort to identify the most capable operatives, the CDF have partnered with Anvil Aerospace to give away a handful of F8C Superiority Fighters to anyone who can successfully turn in a platinum certification ticket. \n\nOne of these tickets has just been found by ~mission(PlayerThatFound). They will be attempting to turn it into an eligible ship kiosk at New Deal, Astro Armada, or the Crusader Showroom. Should you accept, you are charged with trying to stop them. If you obtain the ticket yourself and can get to the kiosk, the ship can be yours, but understand that you will be the hunted now.\n\nGood luck.

+ HeadHunters_RepUI_Area=Pyro
+ HeadHunters_RepUI_Description=One of the oldest gangs in the Pyro System, the Headhunters have earned themselves a reputation for being ruthless and respected. Unlike many outlaws, when the Headhunters strike a deal they're known for keeping their word. Especially if they promise to kill someone. They are currently seeking to wrest control of Ruin Station away from XenoThreat.

+ HeadHunters_RepUI_Leadership=Kima "Bats" Farrell

+ Headhunters_bounty_desc_001=The Headhunters recently loaned credits to ~mission(TargetName) under some clear conditions. Specifically, pay us back or we’ll kill you. Wild to think that wasn’t enough of an incentive, but here we are past the payment deadline. Now as much as we like ~mission(TargetName|First), I need you to make good on our promise.\n\n~mission(TargetName|Last) was last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). Track ‘em down, ghost ‘em, and get paid. It’s as simple as that. \n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_bounty_desc_002=Time is up for ~mission(TargetName). The skav is way past due on paying back the Headhunters, so I need you to punch them out. \n\nKill ‘em, not hit ‘em, just in case that’s unclear. \n\nSomeone recently spotted ~mission(TargetName|Last) around ~mission(Location|Address), so head there and take ‘em out.  \n\nFull disclosure, we’ve gotten reports they used some of our creds to hire extra protection. Prepare accordingly. \n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_bounty_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) borrowed a bunch of creds from the Headhunters and thought the smart move was to try and hide instead of paying us back, so I need someone to make an example of ~mission(TargetName|Last).\n\nThey were just spotted at ~mission(Location|Address), so I’d recommend heading there now before the trail goes cold. ~mission(TargetName|Last) is a paranoid sort, so don’t be surprised if they’re not alone. Handle it however you want as long as ~mission(TargetName|Last) is dust when you’re done.   \n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_bounty_title_001=Deadbeat
+ Headhunters_bounty_title_002=Past Due
+ Headhunters_bounty_title_003=Collection Notice
+ Headhunters_bounty_xenothreat_desc_001=Headhunters got word there’s a XenoThreat op in the works that's targeting one of our crews. We don’t have precise details about the plan but we know that ~mission(TargetName) is organizing it. Instead of sitting back and waiting for something to happen, we’ve decided to be proactive. \n\n~mission(TargetName|Last) was just spotted with others around ~mission(Location|Address). We can’t mobilize anyone fast enough to get there. I want you to rush there and deliver a preemptive strike.   \n\nStows out. 
+ Headhunters_bounty_xenothreat_desc_002=XenoThreat recently hit a Headhunters' stronghold. I’ll spare you the details, but they did some truly heinous shit to our crew. We’ve identified the leader of the op as ~mission(TargetName) and are looking for a little payback. We don’t care what you do to get the job done. Only that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is dead. \n\nA source just told us that you can track down this XenoThreat scum over at ~mission(Location|Address). This sicko’s a pro and never travels alone, so don’t expect taking them out to be a walk in the park.  \n\nStows out. 
+ Headhunters_bounty_xenothreat_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) was recently revealed to be a mole for XenoThreat. It all makes sense now because the skav was a major asshole. Unfortunately, they split before we could handle it ourselves. \n\nBased on all they learned about our ops, we need ‘em taken out pronto. They see one of us coming and they’ll just run again, but I figured someone like you has a better chance of getting close enough for a killshot. \n\nWe just got word ~mission(TargetName|Last) was hanging around ~mission(Location|Address). Looks like there’s other ships around protecting ‘em too. Think you got the skill to rid the ‘verse of a traitorous bastard and their bastard friends?  \n\nStows out.\n

+ Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_easy=Some numbskull is trying to dig up dirt on the Headhunters. Some orbital sentries were dropped at ~mission(location|address) to spy on us. We’ve also spotted a ship checking on them. Simple proposition for you. Go wipe out the sentries there and we’ll pay you for it. That sound like something you’d be into?\n\nAs for the ship, you can do whatever you want with it, but if it spots you, don’t be surprised if it tries to go get some back up. That’s just how these things go.\n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_hard=Some idiots think they can blatantly spy on the Headhunters and get away with it. They’ve set up several orbital sentries at ~mission(location|address) and have a few ships patrolling the area. We don’t know who’s behind it but we honestly don’t care. We just need it gone. \n\nLet us know if you feel like putting some real brash bastards in their place. We’ll pay you well and deliver the creds the second the job is done. \n\nKeep in mind that it’s really only the sentries we care about. The ships they got patrolling are only a concern if they get in your way or if they try to call in some friends to stop you. \n \nStows out.
+ Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_intro=Got a minor annoyance the Headhunters need dealt with. There's an orbital sentry at ~mission(location|address) that some pesky little troublemaker set up to spy on our ops. Want to make some easy creds and go blow it up for us?\n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_medium=Headhunters are looking for a merc to do a little clean up for us. Found out that someone’s trying to spy on us over at ~mission(location|address). Can’t let that stand. We need a skilled operator to take care of the orbital sentries they dropped there, and if needed, deal with any of their ships that get in your way. Seems like a decently run op, so hitting it might not be easy but it sure should be fun. \n\nLet us know if you’re the right one for the gig. Creds will be transferred once our scans show it’s gone. \n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_claimsweep_desc_rand=Headhunters recently discovered some orbital sentries focused on our operations and we don’t like it one bit. I’m looking to pay someone to go to ~mission(location|address) and make it abundantly clear they should stay the hell out of our business. Doubt they’ll be receptive to a discussion about it, so I’d be prepared to evict them with extreme force. \n\nBased on our scans, this won’t be a walk in the park. Wouldn’t be a bad idea to come prepared with plenty of ammo. Payment will be sent promptly once the job is done. \n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_claimsweep_title_easy=Eliminate Eavesdroppers

+ Headhunters_claimsweep_title_medium=Eradicate Eavesdroppers
+ Headhunters_claimsweep_title_rand=Execute Eavesdroppers
+ Headhunters_destroy_server_CFP_desc_01=Guess these Citizen for Pyro skids are trying to make a case for the UEE to come into Pyro and have been gathering info on Headhunter “criminal activity and heinous wrongdoing.” Seems no one explained that there’s no such thing as criminal activity out here since there ain’t no laws.\n\nEither way, it’s info we’d rather the UEE not get their hands on. Figure the simplest solution is to hire you to head over to ~mission(location|address) and destroy the data servers Citizens for Pyro are storing the info on. \n\nBoom. No more problem.\n\nNow, my understanding is that the locals didn’t know what the servers are for, so if it were up to me I’d say keep the collateral damage to a minimum, but hell, if they try to stop you, do what you have to.\n\n-Stows\n
+ Headhunters_destroy_server_CFP_title_01=Explosive Evidence
+ Headhunters_eliminateall_caves_desc_01=Hey,\n\nSome two-bit thugs are holed up in ~mission(location|address). Wouldn’t pay them any mind, except the arrogant skags tried to hit an outpost under our protection.\n\nWe chased 'em off with little trouble, but we can't let that kind of disrespect go unpunished. Our Clips are busy with some bigger fish, so we'd like you to take care of this for us. \n\n~mission(Location|CaveSize) And seeing as these bastards are already underground, you won’t even need to bother burying them when you're done.\n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_eliminateall_caves_title_01=A Swift Reprisal
+ Headhunters_eliminatespecific_caves_desc_01=Listen up,\n\nI’ve had my eyes on an independent crew based in ~mission(location|address). They could be good recruits for us, but their leader’s getting in the way.\n\nThe prick in charge is ~mission(targetname). Word is they’ve got no love for us and are making overtures to XenoThreat. That’s a problem. We’d like to hire you to take ‘em out and make space for someone else to lead them in a more acceptable direction.  \n\n~mission(Location|CaveSize) I’d prefer if you limited the collateral damage, but I won’t hold you to it. \n\n- Stows
+ Headhunters_eliminatespecific_caves_title_01=Course Correction
+ Headhunters_salvage_open_nochicken_desc_001=A Headhunter crew scored big on a passing merchant convoy near ~mission(location|address), but there was a lot left over after we had our fill.\n\nLucky for you, most of the ship remains are in decent enough condition to be salvaged. We took what we want, so we’re selling the location to anyone who wants it. If that’s you, send us your credits and we’ll transfer the coordinates. They’ll remain in your map until you abandon the contract.\n\nThe faster you decide, the faster you get to start tearing apart these ships before the competition does.\n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_salvage_open_nochicken_title_001=Convoy Clean Up
+ Headhunters_salvage_open_rivalchicken_desc_001=One of our crews just had a run-in near ~mission(location|address) with some assholes who thought they could step to us. I think they learned their lesson, but now there’s several ship’s worth of salvage ready for anyone who wants it.\n\nI’m selling the coords so buy in, salvage, cancel the contract when you’re done. Should be a decent payday depending on how many others decide to show.\n\nThere’s a chance that these nobodies might’ve had friends so I wouldn’t be surprised if some of their people started sniffin’ round. Handle ‘em quick and you should be fine. Just more to salvage, right?\n\n- Stows
+ Headhunters_salvage_open_rivalchicken_title_001=Salvage Free-for-All
+ Headhunters_salvage_open_xenothreat_desc_001=Read fast. Lots of credits on the line. \n\nXenoThreat came after a Headhunter crew recently and it wasn’t pretty. Lots of ships went down near ~mission(location|address) and I got wind that those bastards are out there trying to recover their ships – and ours – so they can use the parts again or whatever those assholes do. All I know is I’d rather someone else clean ‘em out first.\n\nThat’s why I’m selling the coords to all any friends who want ‘em. Won’t even make it too expensive. Salvage as much as you can and whenever you’re satisfied, cancel the contract and call it a day.\n\nLast bit of advice – you might want to bring some back-up – these nutjobs field some serious firepower.\n\nStows out.
+ Headhunters_salvage_open_xenothreat_title_001=XenoThreat Salvage for Grabs
+ Headhunters_theft_outpost_xenothreat_desc_001=XenoThreat recently destroyed one of our supply ships. Not sure if they thought it was filled with alien-made weapons, Tevarin settlers, or whatever, but now we’re running low on some things. Seems only right that XenoThreat pay up for what they did.   \n\nI need someone to grab the ~mission(item) from ~mission(Pickup1|Address) and deliver it to ~mission(Dropoff1|Address).\n\nHighly doubt these assholes will let you get your hands on these crates without putting up a fight. Probably best to put together a crew and gear up before heading out.\n\nStows out

+ Tut03_Part03_Journal01_TraversingtheVerse_Content=Congratulations!\n\nYou’ve completed the Star Citizen Tutorial and are ready to explore the universe! \n\nNow it’s up to you decide what your life in space will be like. The Contract Manager on your mobiGlas contains many different opportunities for you to pursue from simple delivery missions to dangerous criminal jobs. Work hard and you can build your reputation with different organizations to gain access to more rewarding contracts. Whether you choose to live a life of crime or hunt down bounties and enforce the law, it is up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’d rather forge your own path, feel free to use the StarMap in the mobiGlas and explore all the Stanton system has to offer. From the snowy wastelands of microTech to the floating city of Orison, there is still much for you to learn and discover. If you ever need further assistance, you can seek the guidance of experienced players through the Guide system on Spectrum (on the Roberts Space Industries website), read the helpful posts in the online Knowledge Base, or ask for a helping hand in chat. Your journal is also a valuable resource, containing entries that summarize and elaborate on everything covered in the tutorial.\n\nBut once you venture beyond the major cities and space stations, take care. Outside of these protected armistice zones you will encounter many dangers in the search for profit. Wherever your next steps take you, safe flying!\n\nPRACTICE MAKES PERFECT\nIf you’re interested in practicing flying or experiencing combat without risking your ship, Star Citizen features an arcade mode called ‘Arena Commander’ as an option in the game’s main menu.\n\nMOBIGLAS\nYour mobiGlas personal computer features a variety of functions and apps essential to life in the ‘verse.

+ Tutorial01_Area18_JournalToken,P=Currently, you are in Area 18, on ArcCorp, the third planet in the Stanton System – a great distance from Humanity’s origins in the Sol System. The four planets in the system are owned by megacorporations who each purchased a planet from the UEE and now govern their own region of space. They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\n~mission(Location|Name) is the main commercial zone of the mega-city that sprawls across the surface of ArcCorp. From here, the tutorial will guide you to ~mission(Destination), the space station in orbit above the planet that can serve as your gateway to further exploration of the Stanton system.

They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\n~mission(Location|Name) is a luxurious domed city that serves as the corporate headquarters to microTech, the leading computer and software developer in the Empire best known for making the mobiGlas. From here, the tutorial will guide you to ~mission(Destination), the space station in orbit above the planet that can serve as your gateway to further exploration of the Stanton system.

We believe this is part of an espionage campaign targeting XenoThreat, most likely funded by the UEE. \n\nWe’re looking for an experienced merc willing to destroy the sentries ASAP.  Since they already have eyes and ears on us, sending in someone from outside the org would draw less attention. If you take the gig, you’ll be paid promptly once the sentries are destroyed.\n \nNow, while the patrol ship isn’t the main target, we suspect that if it escapes it might have reinforcements in reserve.

If you don’t want Pyro to become a surveillance system, then this is your chance to stop it. The sentries probably won’t be too big of an issue, but pay mind to the patrol ships.

The sentries are the priority, but the ships might prove a bigger issue if they’re allowed to escape. You’ll have to evaluate the situation more closely once you’re on site. \n\nWe could take care of it ourselves, but want to send in a contractor so the scum behind it don’t know who hit them.

Unfortunately, there’s been a lot of outlaw activity in that area lately, so the odds are pretty good you’ll cross paths with some kind of criminal. If you do, you need to be careful as they could rush off to bring back reinforcements, so you’ll need to act quick.\n\nWarnings aside, the coords are available to buy if you think the risk is worth the salvage. Remember that the credits you pay go right back to the local who discovered the wreck and supports building a stronger and safer Pyro system.\n\nIf you do take the contract, feel free to cancel it once you’ve collected enough salvage.\n\nFly safe out there,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro

From what I’ve been able to find out, they were scouting out near ~mission(location|address) which is a known outlaw hotspot. \n\nI’m hoping you’d be able to go there for us and see if you can locate them, or worse comes to worse, their remains. ~mission(Location|CaveSize)\n\nIf you are able to find them, there’s a reward on offer. \n\nThanks,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro\n

Their family contacted Citizens for Pyro for help and I told them we would do what we could. That said, with so much time passed, I’m not too hopeful. \n\nWhatever their current state is, I was hoping you could be our eyes on the ground for this one. There’s a strong chance that they were headed to ~mission(Location|Address), an area known to be very dangerous.\n\nIf you can track them down and confirm their status, one way or another, I’ll see that you’re properly compensated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro\n

They finished up a trade at ~mission(Location|Address) and haven’t been seen since. We’re hearing reports that outlaws have been sneaking aboard there, and if that’s true, I suspect that the worst might have happened.\n\nEither way, ~mission(TargetName|First) has done good work for us in the past and I’d hate for them to wind up as just another one of Pyro’s missing. If you’re willing to find them for me, I’ll see that you get a reward. \n\nJust be careful. Hate for you to go missing too.\n\nThanks,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro\n

That is until they went missing while exploring ~mission(Location|Address) last week. Unfortunately, I didn’t hear about it until today. Chances of survival at this point are pretty slim, but I still think its worth confirming what happened to them.\n \nI could use your help on this if you’re interested.

I’m hoping that they just ran into some bad luck, but too often out here even the smallest misstep can prove fatal.\n\nI’d appreciate you heading that way and seeing if you can locate them. It’d be great if you find them alive, but if not, I figure some closure is the least we can do for their family.\n\nThanks,\n\nLima Endicott\nLead Dispatcher\nCitizens for Pyro\n

+ roughready_bounty_cargoship_desc_001=Rough & Ready recently provided fueling services for a hauler named ~mission(TargetName), who agreed to deliver their next load of supplies to us as compensation. Well, we just found out that the lying skag sold their latest shipment to a rival gang instead. \n\nWe’re looking for someone to track down and eliminate ~mission(TargetName|Last) for the double cross. \n\nAn old friend of mine just spotted the skag at ~mission(Location|Address). Looks like they're loaded with more cargo that’s not coming our way, and traveling with an escort. We’re only paying you to take out the ship, so anything you find aboard is yours to keep.\n\n- Smokey\n
+ roughready_bounty_cargoship_desc_002=My associates and I brokered a deal with a hauler named ~mission(TargetName) to deliver supplies to us. Funny thing is the shipment never showed up. They claimed pirates raided their ship and took our supplies, but it turns out that story’s 100% ranta dung.\n\nLying to back out of our deal can’t go unanswered and you’re going to make that message abundantly clear. ~mission(TargetName|Last) was recently seen with an escort at ~mission(Location|Address). As long as you kill ~mission(TargetName|Last), we don’t care what happens to the cargo they’re hauling. \n\n- Smokey\n

Even loaded the damn thing up with real cargo to make sure it passes scans. We’ve spread the word so nobody in Rough & Ready will fall for the trap again, but I want this skag punished. \n\nI think ~mission(TargetName|Last) knows a lot of our people on sight, so I’m guessing it’ll be better to pay you to take care of it.

We’ve discovered a ship and orbital sentries at ~mission(location|address) spyin’ on us. We’re in a bit of a bind because we don’t want to start a larger fight with whoever’s behind this. That’s why we’re looking for some hired help who can quickly and discreetly take care of it for us. Interested?\n\nLast thing, once you’re out there, make sure to keep an eye on that ship.

+ roughready_claimsweep_desc_hard=The Rough & Ready crew is looking for an independent merc interested in something heavy. We’ve been keeping an eye on a developing situation at ~mission(location|address) where ships are guarding several orbital sentries spying on our operations.      \n\nNow, I might’ve been born at night, but it wasn’t last night. Considering the blatant way they’re set up, whoever’s responsible had to know we’d eventually discover it. Almost feels like they’re baiting R&R into attacking it, and I don’t want us falling for it. \n\nInstead, you’re gonna do it for us and get paid a damn good amount of creds for your effort. The ships stationed there will be less suspicious of an unaffiliated ship approaching and make it harder to pin the attack on us. \n\nJust be sure to plan accordingly before heading in. Maybe bring your own reinforcements in case any of their ships escape and call in some of their own.     \n\n- Smokey\n
+ roughready_claimsweep_desc_intro=My associates and I have found ourselves in a little predicament and could use some help. There’s an orbital sentry at ~mission(location|address) that’s spying on us. We don’t know who put it there, but it sure as hell can’t stay. \n\nThing is we’re business minded folks first and foremost and worry that if we blow it up ourselves it’ll start shit. That’s why it’s better if someone like you does it. Should be a quick and easy gig for someone interested in earning some creds.   \n\n- Smokey
+ roughready_claimsweep_desc_medium=Recently made an interesting discovery that someone set up a handful of orbital sentries at ~mission(location|address). Guess they’re trying to grab some info about our operations there. They even have a few ships guarding to make sure nothing happens to them. \n\nOf course, we want these bastards gone, but I’m worried that getting rid of it ourselves would be bad for business. That’s why we’re looking for a little ‘plausible deniability’. Someone from outside of R&R to eliminate the problem, so whoever is behind it can’t directly tie the attack back to us. I know this won’t be a walk in the park, especially with those guards lurking. Who knows how many reinforcements they have at the ready? But if you manage to get it done, we’re prepared to see you paid right. \n\nThink you’ve got the skills to pull this off? \n\n- Smokey\n
+ roughready_claimsweep_desc_rand=Interested in getting your hands dirty? Turns out someone set up a little operation at ~mission(location|address) to spy on Rough & Ready’s business dealings. They’ve got several orbital sentries and guard ships posted there. We don’t know who’s behind it, what kind of reinforcements they have waiting, or why they’re targeting us, but it’s definitely not for something good.  \n\nNow, we could take care of it ourselves but have business interests to consider. Sometimes the best way to protect those interests is to hire mercs to do our dirty work. If you’re interested in making good creds and gaining a little good will with the R&R, now’s your chance.

A few hours ago, we determined that they were hit by a Headhunter raiding party and the contents of the ship’s datastores were transferred to their servers at ~mission(location|address). \n\nWhile we have every reason to believe that our encryption will hold, we cannot take the risk that the contents of those files will be exposed. You are being ordered to head there and ensure our data remains private by destroying the Headhunter servers.\n\nI strongly encourage thoroughness. Raze everything and everyone you can to the ground.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler\n

+ xenothreat_eliminateall_CFP_outpost_desc_01=The group of instigators that calls itself “Citizens for Pyro” can no longer be allowed to continue spreading their lies and propaganda without repercussion.\n\nAs a sharp reminder of who really controls Pyro we have issued a kill order to eradicate all “Citizen” presence at ~mission(location|address). Resistance is likely, but we expect you to handle it with little difficulty. Do as directed and you’ll be paid well for your work.\n\nComm. Spec. Engler

+ xenothreat_eliminatespecific_desc_001=XenoThreat’s efforts to keep outside influences from infecting this system is being tested by a group that dares to call itself Citizens for Pyro. A prominent group member, ~mission(TargetName), has established operations at ~mission(Location|Address) and is already hard at work spreading their lies and propaganda to anyone that will listen. If we want Pyro to remain independent of UEE and alien influence, then something must be done about this now.  \n\nThat’s why XenoThreat is issuing a kill order for ~mission(TargetName|Last). And knowing how important they are to Citizens for Pyro’s operations, I wouldn’t be surprised if you had to fight your way through a bunch of their most fanatical followers first before you even get a shot at them. But remember ~mission(TargetName|Last) is your target, and payment hinges solely on you making sure they’re eliminated. \n\nComm. Spec. Engler
+ xenothreat_eliminatespecific_desc_002=The Headhunters have assembled a special strike team whose sole purpose is to attack, disrupt, and undermine our operations. As much as I’m loath to admit it, they’ve had a few small successes and are quickly becoming a concern. \n\nXenoThreat knows the best way to kill a snake is by cutting off its head, so we’re issuing a kill order for the strike team’s commander ~mission(TargetName), who according to our intelligence sources, has been hiding at ~mission(Location|Address) for a few days now. \n\nI’d expect strong resistance from the Headhunter forces there. From what we’ve heard, ~mission(TargetName|Last) got this command partially because of the fierce loyalty they inspire in others.

The four planets in the system are owned by megacorporations who each purchased a planet from the UEE and now govern their own region of space. They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\nArea18 is the main commercial zone of the mega-city that sprawls across the surface of ArcCorp.

You can use this screen to arrange and organize your items, transferring them between your Personal Inventory and Local Storage or equipping them to your character. Take note that certain items have requirements for when they can be equipped, such as armor needing to be placed on an undersuit. All inventories have a capacity bar near the top that indicates how much they can store. \n\nLOCAL STORAGE\nYour Local Storage is unique to the current zone you are in. For example, if you are on microTech you will no longer have access to your Area18 storage. While Local Storages are significantly larger than Personal Inventories, they still have their own maximum capacity.\n\nAs you accumulate a high number of items, you can use the tabs at the top of the Local Inventory window to filter through specific categories of items and equipment.\n\nVehicles also have their own storage capacity. This inventory is not shared with any other players aboard and remains accessible to you while onboard the vehicle or while that vehicle is parked at your current landing zone.\n\nLOSING ITEMS\nRemember, when you get into dangerous situations out in the ‘verse you risk losing your items! Things in your personal inventory at the time of your death will remain on your corpse and will need to be retrieved. The same is true when a vehicle is destroyed. There is a chance that other players will find and claim your lost items before you can.\n\nAnything in storage at a major city landing zone is safe regardless of what happens to you or your vehicles.
