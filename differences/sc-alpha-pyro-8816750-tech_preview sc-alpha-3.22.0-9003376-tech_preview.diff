+ BrightSky_Desc=The CDF has partnered with Anvil Aerospace to find the most capable operatives in the system. \n\nIf you find one of these Platinum certifications, you can redeem the ticket at a ship kiosk at New Deal, Astro Armada or Crusader Showroom for a free F8C. \n\nThe catch is that your identity and location has been shared with participants throughout the system. For everyone else, if you can stop the ticketholder before they get to the kiosk, you can claim the ticket for your own.\n\nWhoever makes it will not only receive this next generation superiority fighter, but also prove that they have what it takes for the toughest CDF assignments.\n\nGood luck.

Security’s already searching for it and if they find it, they’ll ID it for sure and we’ll be in loads of trouble.\n\nSo, we want you to make sure that can’t happen. Either tow the ship out of the search area or rip the entire hull off so nobody can tell who it belonged to. Whatever you decide, keep your mouth shut about this. \n\nWe’ll cred you up and anything you scrap is yours to keep.

You’ve probably got about ~mission(timer) minutes until security gets there to check out the wreck. Could be more, could be less.\n\nYou could either tow it somewhere else first, or you could try to scrap what you can onsite before security shows. Don’t care which as long as you get it taken care of. And once you've salvaged everything you want, just go ahead and abandon this contract to clear your map. Helps keep everything nice and tidy.

+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_01=I need some muscle to help me hit ~mission(location|address). It’s an easy job that shouldn’t take more than twenty minutes. All you gotta do is get tap into the facility’s mainframe, let me into the system, and make sure nobody interferes while I rip through 3 of their servers.\n\nThere are guards on-site, but if you’re quick you should be able to get out before the heavies arrive. And for this job, I'll be able keep track of their cybersecurity team remotely and flag any sabotaged servers for you to fix. Can't afford to lose too many. \n\nAs for the mainframe, they should have a way to access it on site, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to take a cryptokey in case you need to hack your way in. Usually, this kind of job requires a crew, but I figure you could probably solo this one and keep more of the creds for yourself. Don’t really care either way as long as it gets done.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_02=Got some more info that needs liberating at ~mission(location|address) and I was hoping you’d be my hands on the scene.\n\nAs usual, you’ll need to help me get into their network by finding a way to access the mainframe on site or by bringing a cryptokey. Once my link is secure, I’m expecting you to keep things in order until I’ve pulled data from 4 of their servers. \n\nNow, I’m gonna be blind as far as any security goes, so you and whoever you bring will need to keep an eye on the servers yourself. We can lose a few of them, but any more than that and this job’ll be a bust.\n\nThe pay should be enough to cover you and the other person you convince to tag along.\n\nLet’s make it happen,\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_03=Got another job ready to pull the trigger on, though it might be a little tougher than usual. I need to rip 5 servers worth of data from ~mission(location|address).\n\nSame plan as usual. Find a way into the mainframe on site or hack your way in with a cryptokey, then make sure security doesn’t interfere with the servers while I pull the data. Now, unfortunately, I’m expecting them to be much more responsive than usual. If they catch wind of someone poking around, they might try to remotely take down their own servers to keep us from getting to them.\n\nMake sure to take a couple people you can trust with you, this won’t be the kind of job you can just wing on your own and I won’t be caught out just because you’re feeling cocky.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_04=Got something big in the works. I know you’re skilled enough to pull this off, but it won’t be easy. I need you to raid ~mission(location|address) while I hook in and download the facility’s data.\n\nOnce you get me mainframe access, you’ll have to guard the servers out until I get the data off 6 of them. Make sure you’re ready to dig in because the transfer’s gonna take about 40 minutes, during which you’ll need to deal with their onsite and remote security trying to shut us down any way they can.\n\nYou should bring some friends too. I can’t see you pulling this off without at least 3 other people to help protect the upload. And just so you know, If I don’t get the data from all 6 servers, none of us will get paid.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_05=Ready for a big score? Got word that there’s valuable intel being kept at ~mission(location|address) and we’re gonna steal it.\n\nI want you to put a team together of at least 4 people and get me into the mainframe so I can pull data from 7 of their servers. Ripping that much data is gonna take at least 45 minutes, so make sure you’re geared up for a long one.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that their security’s going to throw everything they can to stop us and since we can’t afford to lose more than a couple servers, they’ve got the advantage.\n\nAs usual, this is an all or nothing kind of situation. If I don’t get through all 7 servers, you don’t get any credits. I get what I need, we all get rich.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c

Retrieval codes are stored locally on datapads and only given to high-ranking staff. Hopefully they’re alive to help you, but considering the complete comms blackout, we fear that’s not the case. There's a chance Nine Tails have already gotten their hands on the datapads.  \n\nOnce you’ve gathered all the confidential materials, they will need to be delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address).

Livingston\nRISK ASSESSMENT: High\nRUSH CONTRACT: Yes\n\nHurston has learned that the Nine Tails are attacking ~mission(Location|address). Our on-site forces have suffered heavy casualties and stopped responding to comms. Initial reports indicated that the gang was attempting to obtain confidential material recently delivered to the facility. Thankfully, we have security measures in place that should give us time to respond. We need an operative to head to the facility immediately, retrieve those boxes, and deliver them to a secure location.\n\nYou and whatever backup you choose to bring are authorized to take any actions necessary when confronting the trespassers. Suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Hurston will not provide material support and/or updates regarding the status of the facility's security forces. \n\nThe confidential materials were discreetly delivered alongside other boxes in a consignment and locked in our automated vault with access codes kept on datapads held by senior security staff. However, there’s a strong chance Nine Tails may already have gotten their hands on them. You’ll need to find those datapads and then enter the codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the confidential materials. Payment will be sent once they have been delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). \n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material. Any review, retransmission, dissemination, or other use of or taking action in reliance upon this information by persons or entities other than the intended recipient is prohibited. **

+ mtps_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ABOUT THE JOB\nmicroTech Protection Services need a security professional for a retrieval op at ~mission(Location). The location is currently under attack and security forces on-site are unresponsive and presumed dead. We believe confidential materials recently delivered to the facility for temporary holding were the target of the raid. Your main focus will be collecting those boxes and delivering them to a secure location.  \n\nFor security reasons, the confidential materials were delivered as part of a larger shipment and secured in the automated vault. The materials have unique retrieval codes that must be entered on the keypad at the package conveyor. Protocols require that only senior security officers can carry a datapad containing a code, but considering the volatile situation, we can't guarantee that the Nine Tails haven’t taken possession of them. Once secured, deliver all of the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1) for payment.\n\nRESPONSIBILITIES\n• Provide own transportation to ~mission(Location|address).\n• Use force as necessary to collect the confidential materials.\n• Deliver the confidential materials to ~mission(dropoff1|address).\n\nMINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS\n• 2 years of combined mercenary and/or security experience.\n• Access to combat equipment. \n• Access to a spaceship that can transport cargo.\n• Available for immediate deployment.\n\nPREFERRED QUALIFICATIONS\n• Experience with rapid hostility de-escalation techniques.\n• Experience hauling important cargo.

Unfortunately, I don’t have a schematic of the facility, so if the owners remote in to try and hamper our uploads, you’ll have to figure out which servers are in danger by yourself.\n\nIt should be a ~mission(lengthoftime) with ~mission(leewayamount).\n\nBecause of all the moving parts, this job might take more than two brain cells, which means you’ll probably want to get some help on this. You’ll have to split the payout, but that’s better than regenning and wasting our time.. And your time, I guess.

- bitzeros_dataheist_tutorial_desc_01,P=Hey,\n\nI need some muscle to hit ~mission(location|address) and word is that you’re right for the job.\n\nThe facility has ~mission(quantity) ~mission(filesize) ~mission(fileplural) under lock and key that I’m looking to get my hands on. I need you to get access to their mainframe, accept our connection request, and make sure nobody interrupts us while we’re pulling everything to our own servers. \n\nThe mainframe will be encrypted, so if you don’t keep a cryptokey handy, you’ll need to get the access card from the facility’s on-site technician. Once you’ve gotten me connected to their servers, the system failsafes are going to try and boot us, but I’ll be able to mark any troubled servers that’ll need your direct intervention. Just stay alertpay attention and we should be fine.\n\nAll that considered, when everything’s in motion it should be ~mission(lengthoftime). And if you’re not as capable as my data says, there’s ~mission(LeewayAmount) anyways, just don’t take that as a reason to slack off. In fact, I’d recommend you bring some friends along for this one. \n\nIf you do a good job here, I could have more work for you down the line so don’t screw it up. I hate changing my plans.
