# Added
+ BrightSky_Desc=The CDF has partnered with Anvil Aerospace to find the most capable operatives in the system. You have just found a Platinum certification for a free F8C from Anvil. To redeem it, you will need to turn in the ticket to any ship kiosk at New Deal, Astro Armada or Crusader Showroom. \n\nThe catch is that your identity and location has been shared with participants throughout the system. Odds are they will try to stop you from reaching the kiosk.\n\nIf you make it, you will not only receive this next generation superiority fighter, but also prove that you have what it takes for the toughest CDF assignments.\n\nGood luck.

+ TarPits_ShipStrip_desc_001=Got a particular salvage job that we could use some extra hands on. \n\nWe need you to find a ~mission(ship) that got punched out around ~mission(location). Security’s already searching for it and if they find it, they’ll ID it for sure and we’ll be in loads of trouble.\n\nSo, we want you to scrape it clean before anybody else gets eyes on it. Rip the entire hull off so nobody can tell who it belonged to, don’t leave a speck of paint, and obviously keep your mouth shut about anything you see. \n\nWe’ll cred you up and anything you scrap is yours to keep. But if security finds the ship before you’re done, we’ll all be screwed and you won’t get paid so don’t disappoint.
+ TarPits_TimedSalvage_Desc_01=We’ve got our eye on a ~mission(ship) near ~mission(location) that’s ripe for salvaging. We’re too busy to snag it ourselves, so why not spread the wealth, right?\n\nIf you send us some credits, we’ll send you the ship’s exact coordinates. Don’t take too long to think it over, though. You’ve probably got about ~mission(timer) minutes until security gets there to check out the wreck. Could be more, could be less.\n\nIf you’re fast enough, you can get in, get your haul, and get out without a shot fired. Not a bad deal, right? And once you've salvaged everything you want, just go ahead and abandon this contract to clear your map. Helps keep everything nice and tidy.

+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_01,P=Hey loser,\n\nWe’ve got a job in the works that needs some hands and, fortunately for you, we’re too busy to go to touch grass so we need some boots on the ground. Got a pair?\n\nThere’s valuable intel being kept under lock in key in the servers at ~mission(location|address) and Bit Zeros are looking pull off a digital jailbreak and grab We’re looking to pull ~mission(quantity) ~mission(filesize) ~mission(fileplural). \n\nAs usual, you’ll need to get an access card on site or bring a cryptokey so you can open a connection to the mainframe for us. While we’re downloading the data out to our own servers, you’ll have to make sure nobody interrupts the process. Unfortunately, I don’t have a schematic of the facility, so if the owners remote in to try and hamper our uploads, you’ll have to figure out which servers are in danger by yourself.\n\nIt should be a ~mission(lengthoftime) with ~mission(leewayamount).\n\nBecause of all the moving parts, this job might take more than two brain cells, which means you’ll probably want to get some help on this. You’ll have to split the payout, but that’s better than regenning and wasting our time.. And your time, I guess.
+ bitzeros_dataheist_title_01,P=Data Heist at ~mission(location)
+ bitzeros_dataheist_tutorial_desc_01,P=Hey,\n\nI need some muscle to hit ~mission(location|address) and word is that you’re right for the job.\n\nThe facility has ~mission(quantity) ~mission(filesize) ~mission(fileplural) under lock and key that I’m looking to get my hands on. I need you to get access to their mainframe, accept our connection request, and make sure nobody interrupts us while we’re pulling everything to our own servers. \n\nThe mainframe will be encrypted, so if you don’t keep a cryptokey handy, you’ll need to get the access card from the facility’s on-site technician. Once you’ve gotten me connected to their servers, the system failsafes are going to try and boot us, but I’ll be able to mark any troubled servers that’ll need your direct intervention. Just stay alertpay attention and we should be fine.\n\nAll that considered, when everything’s in motion it should be ~mission(lengthoftime). And if you’re not as capable as my data says, there’s ~mission(LeewayAmount) anyways, just don’t take that as a reason to slack off. In fact, I’d recommend you bring some friends along for this one. \n\nIf you do a good job here, I could have more work for you down the line so don’t screw it up. I hate changing my plans.

For everyone else, if you can stop the ticketholder before they get to the kiosk, you can claim the ticket for your own.\n\nWhoever makes it will not only receive this next generation superiority fighter, but also prove that they have what it takes for the toughest CDF assignments.\n\nGood luck.

- bitzeros_dataheist_desc_01=I need some muscle to help me hit ~mission(location|address). It’s an easy job that shouldn’t take more than twenty minutes. All you gotta do is get tap into the facility’s mainframe, let me into the system, and make sure nobody interferes while I rip through 3 of their servers.\n\nThere are guards on-site, but if you’re quick you should be able to get out before the heavies arrive. And for this job, I'll be able keep track of their cybersecurity team remotely and flag any sabotaged servers for you to fix. Can't afford to lose too many. \n\nAs for the mainframe, they should have a way to access it on site, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to take a cryptokey in case you need to hack your way in.

- bitzeros_dataheist_desc_02=Got some more info that needs liberating at ~mission(location|address) and I was hoping you’d be my hands on the scene.\n\nAs usual, you’ll need to help me get into their network by finding a way to access the mainframe on site or by bringing a cryptokey. Once my link is secure, I’m expecting you to keep things in order until I’ve pulled data from 4 of their servers. \n\nNow, I’m gonna be blind as far as any security goes, so you and whoever you bring will need to keep an eye on the servers yourself. We can lose a few of them, but any more than that and this job’ll be a bust.\n\nThe pay should be enough to cover you and the other person you convince to tag along.\n\nLet’s make it happen,\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
- bitzeros_dataheist_desc_03=Got another job ready to pull the trigger on, though it might be a little tougher than usual. I need to rip 5 servers worth of data from ~mission(location|address).\n\nSame plan as usual. Find a way into the mainframe on site or hack your way in with a cryptokey, then make sure security doesn’t interfere with the servers while I pull the data. Now, unfortunately, I’m expecting them to be much more responsive than usual. If they catch wind of someone poking around, they might try to remotely take down their own servers to keep us from getting to them.\n\nMake sure to take a couple people you can trust with you, this won’t be the kind of job you can just wing on your own and I won’t be caught out just because you’re feeling cocky.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
- bitzeros_dataheist_desc_04=Got something big in the works. I know you’re skilled enough to pull this off, but it won’t be easy. I need you to raid ~mission(location|address) while I hook in and download the facility’s data.\n\nOnce you get me mainframe access, you’ll have to guard the servers out until I get the data off 6 of them. Make sure you’re ready to dig in because the transfer’s gonna take about 40 minutes, during which you’ll need to deal with their onsite and remote security trying to shut us down any way they can.\n\nYou should bring some friends too. I can’t see you pulling this off without at least 3 other people to help protect the upload. And just so you know, If I don’t get the data from all 6 servers, none of us will get paid.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
- bitzeros_dataheist_desc_05=Ready for a big score? Got word that there’s valuable intel being kept at ~mission(location|address) and we’re gonna steal it.\n\nI want you to put a team together of at least 4 people and get me into the mainframe so I can pull data from 7 of their servers. Ripping that much data is gonna take at least 45 minutes, so make sure you’re geared up for a long one.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that their security’s going to throw everything they can to stop us and since we can’t afford to lose more than a couple servers, they’ve got the advantage.\n\nAs usual, this is an all or nothing kind of situation. If I don’t get through all 7 servers, you don’t get any credits. I get what I need, we all get rich.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c

All you gotta do is get tap into the facility’s mainframe, let me into the system, and make sure nobody interferes while I rip through 3 of their servers.\n\nThere are guards on-site, but if you’re quick you should be able to get out before the heavies arrive. And for this job, I'll be able keep track of their cybersecurity team remotely and flag any sabotaged servers for you to fix. Can't afford to lose too many. \n\nAs for the mainframe, they should have a way to access it on site, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to take a cryptokey in case you need to hack your way in.
