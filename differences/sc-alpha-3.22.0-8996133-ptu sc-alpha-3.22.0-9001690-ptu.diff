+ GMCapture_Desc=To test the preparedness of our response teams, we would like volunteers to simulate an assault against a CDF Idris by neutralizing and taking control of the vessel.\n\nTo be clear, the goal of the exercise is not to destroy the Idris, but for you to attempt to board the craft and maintain control of it as long as possible. Volunteers should expect to meet full resistance from the Idris' highly trained crew and are encouraged to get an updated imprint beforehand.\n\nCoordinates will be provided upon confirming your participation.\n\nThanks and good luck.
