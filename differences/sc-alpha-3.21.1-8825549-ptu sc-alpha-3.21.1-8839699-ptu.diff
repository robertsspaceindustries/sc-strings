+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_01=I need some muscle to help me hit ~mission(location|address). It’s an easy job that shouldn’t take more than twenty minutes. All you gotta do is get tap into the facility’s mainframe, let me into the system, and make sure nobody interferes while I rip through 3 of their servers.\n\nThere are guards on-site, but if you’re quick you should be able to get out before the heavies arrive. And for this job, I'll be able keep track of their cybersecurity team remotely and flag any sabotaged servers for you to fix. Can't afford to lose too many. \n\nAs for the mainframe, they should have a way to access it on site, but it wouldn’t be a bad idea to take a cryptokey in case you need to hack your way in. Usually, this kind of job requires a crew, but I figure you could probably solo this one and keep more of the creds for yourself. Don’t really care either way as long as it gets done.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_02=Got some more info that needs liberating at ~mission(location|address) and I was hoping you’d be my hands on the scene.\n\nAs usual, you’ll need to help me get into their network by finding a way to access the mainframe on site or by bringing a cryptokey. Once my link is secure, I’m expecting you to keep things in order until I’ve pulled data from 4 of their servers. \n\nNow, I’m gonna be blind as far as any security goes, so you and whoever you bring will need to keep an eye on the servers yourself. We can lose a few of them, but any more than that and this job’ll be a bust.\n\nThe pay should be enough to cover you and the other person you convince to tag along.\n\nLet’s make it happen,\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_03=Got another job ready to pull the trigger on, though it might be a little tougher than usual. I need to rip 5 servers worth of data from ~mission(location|address).\n\nSame plan as usual. Find a way into the mainframe on site or hack your way in with a cryptokey, then make sure security doesn’t interfere with the servers while I pull the data. Now, unfortunately, I’m expecting them to be much more responsive than usual. If they catch wind of someone poking around, they might try to remotely take down their own servers to keep us from getting to them.\n\nMake sure to take a couple people you can trust with you, this won’t be the kind of job you can just wing on your own and I won’t be caught out just because you’re feeling cocky.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_04=Got something big in the works. I know you’re skilled enough to pull this off, but it won’t be easy. I need you to raid ~mission(location|address) while I hook in and download the facility’s data.\n\nOnce you get me mainframe access, you’ll have to guard the servers out until I get the data off 6 of them. Make sure you’re ready to dig in because the transfer’s gonna take about 40 minutes, during which you’ll need to deal with their onsite and remote security trying to shut us down any way they can.\n\nYou should bring some friends too. I can’t see you pulling this off without at least 3 other people to help protect the upload. And just so you know, If I don’t get the data from all 6 servers, none of us will get paid.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c
+ bitzeros_dataheist_desc_05=Ready for a big score? Got word that there’s valuable intel being kept at ~mission(location|address) and we’re gonna steal it.\n\nI want you to put a team together of at least 4 people and get me into the mainframe so I can pull data from 7 of their servers. Ripping that much data is gonna take at least 45 minutes, so make sure you’re geared up for a long one.\n\nIt’s a safe bet that their security’s going to throw everything they can to stop us and since we can’t afford to lose more than a couple servers, they’ve got the advantage.\n\nAs usual, this is an all or nothing kind of situation. If I don’t get through all 7 servers, you don’t get any credits. I get what I need, we all get rich.\n\n57 65 65 76 69 6c

While I’m downloading the data to our servers, you’ll have to make sure nobody interrupts the process. Unfortunately, I don’t have a schematic of the facility, so if the owners remote in to try and hamper our uploads, you’ll have to figure out which servers are in danger by yourself. ~mission(LeewayAmount)\n\nBecause of all the moving parts, you’ll probably want to get some help on this.

Once you’ve gotten me connected to their servers, the system failsafes are going to try and boot us, but I’ll be able to mark any troubled servers that’ll need your attention. Just don’t forget to check the servers and we should be fine. ~mission(LeewayAmount) ~mission(LengthofTime)\n\nThat said, I’d suggest bringing some friends along for this one. \n\nIf you do a good job here, I could have more work for you down the line so don’t screw it up.
